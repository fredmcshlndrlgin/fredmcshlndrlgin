Once you’ve chosen a lender, it’s time to apply. Applying for a personal loan includes filling out an application, usually online, with personal information like your Social Security number, address and contact details. You may also need to submit documentation, including proof of identity, employment and income.

If your application is approved, you’ll sign the loan agreement and receive funds typically within one week, though some lenders fund the same day you’re approved.

Once you have the money, go to each payday lender and pay off your individual debts. This step is the most important; if you skip it and use the money elsewhere, you’ll end up even deeper in debt.

Once your debts are paid off, make a plan to pay off your personal loan. Missed payments can mean a late fee and because lenders report payments to the three major credit bureaus, payments that are 30 or more days late will jeopardize your credit score.

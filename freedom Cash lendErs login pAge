1. Add up your payday loan balances

Your first step in consolidating payday loans is to add up your current balances for all payday loan debt. Personal loan amounts vary, but typically start around $1,000, so youâ€™ll need at least $1,000 in payday debt to apply.
2. Shop around for the best loan

Once you know the amount you need to pay off your debts, shop around and compare loan options from different lenders.

Personal loans are offered at credit unions, online lenders and some banks. Credit unions and online lenders may give favorable rates and terms to applicants with short or no credit history or bad credit scores (629 credit score or lower) than banks.
